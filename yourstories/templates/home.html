      <h2>The Obvious</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Even after <a href="http://www.itv.com/news/2016-05-11/uk-does-get-back-some-of-350m-it-sends-to-eu-boris-johnson-admits/">admitting that this is not the case</a>, Boris continued to use the Â£350m per week figure to mislead the public into voting Leave.</li>
        <li>Moments after the referendum results were announced, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/06/27/george-osborne-to-speak-in-attempt-to-calm-markets-following-bre/">the Pound and the markets dropped harder than Skrillex's career</a> and we're still not done.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>The Less Obvious</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The referendum may never have been about racism or bigotry, but it certainly emboldened racists and bigots. See <a href="https://twitter.com/PostRefRacism">@PostRefRacism on Twitter</a>.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-eu-referendum-campaigners-there-is-no-plan-next-pm-tory-leadership-contest-a7104711.html">There is no plan,</a> according to one Brexit campaigner.</li>
        <li>The referendum triggered <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/26/labour-shadow-cabinet-resignations-jeremy-corbyn-who-has-gone">a massive shadow cabinet reshuffle</a>, with many senior officials leaving.</li>
        <li>The UK may stay in the single market... <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/27/brussels-rejects-boris-johnson-pipe-dream-over-single-market-access">provided it accepts the EU rules without having a say over them</a>.</li>
